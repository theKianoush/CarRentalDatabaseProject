# CarRentalDatabaseProject

Car Rental Database Management System <br />
This was the final project required for my Database Systems class

Uses MySQL to hold all the information in the database - database contains data on Cars, and Customers <br />
Uses PHP and html to access information in database and display it on the website <br />
Uses Apache to access the PHP/HTMLl doc through web browser <br />

The website itself allows you to 
- view all the cars or customers in the database
- add a new car or customer to the database

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The website and its PHP files are contained in the htdocs folder <br />
and <br />
the database is contained in the Database folder <br />
and <br />
the datasets for the database is contained in the DataSets folder <br />

I also included the Relational Shcema  <br />
and the tables corresponding to the Relational Schema  <br />
if you want more insight on the database I was trying to create in MySQL
