# CarRentalDatabaseProject

Car Rental Database Management System
This was the final project required for my Database Systems class

Uses MySQL to hold all the information in the database - database contains data on Cars, and Customers
Uses PHP and html to access information in database and display it on the website
Uses Apache to access the PHP/HTMLl doc through web browser

The website itself allows you to 
- view all the cars or customers in the database
- add a new car or customer to the database

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The website and its PHP files are contained in the htdocs folder
and 
the database is contained in the Database folder
and 
the datasets for the database is contained in the DataSets folder

I also included the Relational Shcema  
and the tables corresponding to the Relational Schema 
if you want more insight on the database I was trying to create in MySQL
